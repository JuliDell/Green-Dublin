                    <p>
                        Embracing a plastic-free ethos is pivotal for safeguarding our environment. Plastic pollution
                        wreaks havoc on ecosystems, threatening wildlife and human health. It contaminates
                        waterways, soils, and air, perpetuating ecological imbalance.
                        Pressuring leaders for decisive action is imperative. Strong policies can curb plastic
                        production, promote alternatives, and enforce recycling measures. By holding leaders
                        accountable, we catalyze systemic change, shifting towards sustainable practices. Our
                        collective voice demands regulations that prioritize environmental protection, fostering a
                        culture of responsibility and innovation.
                        Urging leaders for action is not just a choice; it's a necessity for the preservation of our
                        planet and the well-being of future generations. We demand from Dublin´s leaders a Local
                        Treaty on Plastics. Sign and help us demand concrete actions! Sign the petition.

                    <h3>Become part of the net-zero challenge: Accelerating decarbonization in Dublin</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Net zero means that all greenhouse gas emissions produced are counterbalanced by an
                        equal amount of emissions that are eliminated. Achieving this will require rapid
                        decarbonization.
                        Dublin City Council has approved the local authority climate action plan 2024-2029- Climate
                        Neutral Dublin 2030. It sets out the actions that Dublin City Council is taking to prepare our
                        city and people living here for the known impacts of climate change – fooding, sea level rise,
                        extreme weather events, and drought. Climate Neutral Dublin 2030 sets out how the City
                        Council will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute the global efort to limit
                        warming to below 1.5°C.
                        Claire Byrne, Chair of Climate Action, Energy and Environment SPC, Dublin City Council said,
                        “The journey ahead is going to be difcult and frustrating at times, but it will also be
                        rewarding. Dublin City Council, as a whole is looking forward to working with everyone to make
                        our home a place where everyone can live cleaner, greener, healthier lives.''
                        Became a volunteer and join our group to delve deeper into the plan, monitor and help with
                        the actions to be implemented and demand compliance with agreed deadlines.

                    <h3>Go green: recycling campaign in Dublin</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Ireland’s economy remains linear with waste generation continuing to rise. Recycling rates
                        are not keeping pace with increasing levels of waste generation.
                        Ireland is of track to meet mandatory EU recycling targets set to apply from 2025 for
                        municipal waste, packaging waste and plastic packaging waste. These targets are set to
                        progress the circular economy by prioritising recycling over energy recovery and landfll.
                        Ireland remains overly reliant on unpredictable export markets with almost 382,000 tonnes of
                        residual waste sent for incineration abroad.
                        :he Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in 28th November 2023 the Circular
                        Economy and Waste Statistics Highlights Report 2021. Ireland’s waste generation levels are
                        continuing to rise and Ireland is failing to make sufcient inroads towards key EU recycling
                        targets that apply from 2025 onwards.
                        As Dubliners we want to contribute to increase the recycling rates and thus achieving the EU
                        recycling targets. We understand that the fees charged at the recycling centres and the lack
                        of a policy for free collection of waste to be recycled are factors that contribute to the delay
                        in
                        achieving this goal.
                        Let's put pressure on Dublin City Council to provide a free household waste collection service
                        to all households and ask for a free of charges recycling centres.
