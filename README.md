<h2><font color="green">Wireframes</font></h2>

Wireframes were created for desktop using Balsamiq.

More information about Balsamiq can be found on [Balsamiq website](https://balsamiq.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIroLN0tyShgMVFJJQBh1RCgKrEAAYASAAEgLZmvD_BwE)

Throughout the website development process, the wireframes served as a fundamental tool for visualizing layout, structure, and functionality. However, due to design refinements and aesthetic enhancements adjustments were made to the pages before arriving at the final website version.
